# [@Snuggle](https://github.com/Snuggle)'s Themes for Firefox ðŸ”¥ðŸ¦Š
## Description 
Here are a bunch of themes I've made for Firefox, feel free to use for anything you'd like!

- [Firefloss](#firefloss)
- [Firefloss (no background image)](#firefloss-no-image)
- [Vivaldi Hot Pink](#vivaldi-hot-pink)
- [Moonlight](#moonlight)

### Install
All of these themes below have an install link that looks like `âž• Add '$theme_name' to your Firefox ðŸ”¥ðŸ¦Š`. Click on that and it'll take you to the Mozilla addons install page.

### Editing 
All of these were created using https://color.firefox.com/. To edit any of these themes, change the `.xpi` extension to `.zip` and then open it up to make any changes you'd like. ðŸ˜Š

## Firefloss

### [âž• Add 'Firefloss' to your Firefox ðŸ”¥ðŸ¦Š](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefloss/)

This is a Firefox theme based on the [popular Fairyfloss colour scheme by @sailorhg](https://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/). 
I noticed there was a distinct lack of a Fairyfloss Firefox theme, so I put one together from scratch. I hope you enjoy and feel free to show me your awesome setups! ðŸŒ™âœ¨

## Vivaldi Hot Pink

### [âž• Add 'Vivaldi Hot Pink' to your Firefox ðŸ”¥ðŸ¦Š](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vivaldi-hot-pink/)

This is based upon the colours of the default 'Hot Pink' theme from the [Vivaldi web broswer](https://vivaldi.com/). This theme works really well and is easy on the eyes because of how simplistic it is, but still uses colours I love!
